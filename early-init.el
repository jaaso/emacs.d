;; Emacs HEAD (27+) introduces early-init.el, which is run before init.el,
;; before package and UI initialization happens.

;; A big contributor to startup times is garbage collection. We up the gc
;; threshold to temporarily prevent it from running, then reset it later by
;; enabling `gcmh-mode'. Not resetting it will cause stuttering/freezes.
(setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum)

;; In noninteractive sessions, prioritize non-byte-compiled source files to
;; prevent the use of stale byte-code. Otherwise, it saves us a little IO time
;; to skip the mtime checks on every *.elc file.
(setq load-prefer-newer noninteractive)

;; Prevent the glimpse of un-styled Emacs by disabling these UI elements early.

;; Resizing the Emacs frame can be a terribly expensive part of changing the
;; font. By inhibiting this, we easily halve startup times with fonts that are
;; larger than the system default.
