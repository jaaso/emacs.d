;;; Commentary:

;; This file sets up the essentials for incorporating my init org
;; file.  This is known as "literate programming", which I think is
;; particularly helpful for sharing Emacs configurations with a wider
;; audience that includes new or potential users (I am still very new
;; myself).

;;; Code:

;; A big contributor to startup times is garbage collection. We up the gc
;; threshold to temporarily prevent it from running, and then reset it later
;; using a hook.
